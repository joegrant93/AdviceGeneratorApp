## Overview

This was a fun quick project. It was a new experience working with JSON objects and as such that provided tricky little hurdles to overcome. The generator produces a new piece of advice everytime the page is loaded. Pressing the dice re-loads the entire page. I would like to go back to re-write this to try out using JQuery to load in just the advice, so the whole page does not need reloaded each time. 

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- PHP


### What I learned

I enjoyed putting this project together. I have had experience using flexbox for some previous projects. The only item that provided difficulty in terms of the design for the project was the off-set dice button. It took a few tries to discover a solution that kept the button equally off-set regardless of device size or advice size. 

Retrieving the JSON object from the API provided a couple of hurdles to overcome as I was unfamiliar with the data type before hand. After viewing documentation the solution was straight forwardward and easy to implement. 

### Continued development

As mentioned above I would like to re-visit this project and introduce a JQuery element. This would be used to remove the need to reload the entire web page to change the piece of advice and would provide quicker reaction times from the app. I have at this point not used JQuery much and look forward to improving this project.
